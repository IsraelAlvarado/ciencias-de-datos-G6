Decades of effort in land use mapping have accumulated a series of mapping approaches and land use products. New trends characterized by open big data and advanced artificial intelligence, especially deep learning, offer unprecedented opportunities for mapping land use patterns from regional to global scales. Combined with large amounts of geospatial big data, deep learning has the potential to promote land use mapping to higher levels of scale, accuracy, efficiency, and automation. Here, we comprehensively review the advances in deep learning based urban land use mapping research and practices from the aspects of data sources, classification units, and mapping approaches. More specifically, delving into different settings on deep learning-based land use mapping, we design eight experiments in Shenzhen, China to investigate their impacts on mapping performance in terms of data, sample, and model. For each investigated setting, we provide quantitative evaluations of the discussed approaches to inform more convincing comparisons. Based on the historical retrospection and experimental evaluation, we identify the prevailing limitations and challenges of urban land use classification and suggest prospective directions that could further facilitate the exploitation of deep learning techniques in urban land use mapping using remote sensing and other spatial data across various scales.",2024

This article presents a literature overview covering the innovative actions developed in the scope of smart cities in scientific publications. Furthermore, the scope of the study is identifying innovation initiatives in the performance of actions and solutions for urban spaces.

While most of the literature has concentrated on the effects of population density, this paper calculates the distance between each raster pair within the city's largest continuous built-up area to capture the urban form variation by using the matched data of the European Space Agency Global Land Cover dataset and the Chinese administrative map. For the empirical evidence, we apply the instrumental variables strategy for dealing with the endogeneity between urban form and productivity. We find that urban form deterioration has a statistically significant negative effect on the city's total factor productivity, and the results are still robust with a series of robustness checks. Furthermore, according to the mechanism test, we find that urban form deterioration affects the city's economic performance by discouraging the aggregation of enterprises and population in the city. This study thus sheds new light on the adoption of urban expansion policies to solve the negative externality of urban form deterioration on economic performance in China.",2024

This paper presents a comprehensive review of URT resilience and highlights potential trends and directions for future research. First, URT resilience is defined by three primary abilities: absorption, resistance, and recovery, and four properties: robustness, vulnerability, rapidity, and redundancy. Then, the metrics and assessment approaches for URT resilience were summarized. The metrics are divided into three categories: topology-based, characteristic-based, and performance-based, and the assessment methods are divided into four categories: topological, simulation, optimization, and data-driven. Comparisons of various metrics and assessment approaches revealed that the current research trend in URT resilience is increasingly favoring the integration of traditional methods, such as conventional complex network analysis and operations optimization theory, with new techniques like big data and intelligent computing technology, to accurately assess URT resilience. Finally, five potential trends and directions for future research were identified: analyzing resilience based on multisource data, optimizing train diagram in multiple scenarios, accurate response to passenger demand through new technologies, coupling and optimizing passenger and traffic flows, and optimal line design.",2024

With complex spatial distribution, composition and ecological functions, UV is essential for global carbon cycling and climate change. Therefore, improving UV carbon storage capacity modeling is a research hotspot that deserves extensive investigation. However, the uniqueness of UV lead to great challenges in carbon storage modeling, including (1) limitations in data and algorithms due to complex and sensitive urban environments; (2) the severe scarcity of in-city field observation data (e.g., EC towers and field surveys); (3) difficulty in parameter inversion (e.g., canopy height, LAI, etc.); (4) poor transferability when migrating estimation models from natural vegetation to urban scenarios. The progress in carbon storage modeling in urban settings is reviewed, with detailed discussions on carbon storage modeling methods and major challenges. We then propose strategies to overcome existing challenges, including (1) implementing novel and improved remote sensing (RS) techniques (e.g., hyper-spectral, LiDAR, carbon satellites, etc.) to obtain enhanced structural and functional information on UV; (2) improving critical nodes of the earth observation sensor network, especially the distribution of EC towers in urban settings; (3) leveraging “Model-Data Fusion” technology by integrating big earth data with carbon estimation models to reduce the uncertainty in UV carbon storage estimations.

Nevertheless, the importance of rational urban planning in mitigating it is frequently disregarded. Conducting air quality optimization simulations that consider UFIs (urban form indicators) is an effective approach for air quality-friendly urban planning. Despite its potential, this technique is still in its infancy. This study aims to identify research gaps and uncertainties by summarizing the current research status of key steps in air quality optimization simulation: selecting UFIs, analyzing impact mechanisms of UFIs on air pollution, building air quality models, and proposing optimization strategies through multiple-scenario predictions. Our findings indicate a lack of consistency in selecting UFIs, and an indicator system considers their impact on air quality and urban planning standards proposed by us might be a viable option. Increases in the proportion of construction land, industrial land, and floor area ratio significantly contribute to air pollution, whereas factors such as forest land, public green space, and sky openness have a noteworthy alleviating effect. Typically, statistical modeling is preferred at the city scale while CFD simulation techniques are used at smaller scales. However, future air quality improving through UFIs optimization still lacks a multi-scale nested tool. Thus, further research is recommended to explore combined impacts of various UFIs on different air pollutants under typical scenarios, and develop intelligent, big data-driven air quality models and tools. This review might contribute to transforming air quality optimization that consider UFIs from fragmented academic research to practical application, thereby assisting in global air pollution mitigation efforts.",2023

A novel computational framework with geospatial big data,"Urban public transportation, Public transport travel ratio, High spatial resolution, Linear programming, Supply and demand, Geospatial big data","Improving the travel ratio of public transportation (PTR) is important for realizing low-carbon transportation and sustainable city development. However, limited by data resolution and model accuracy, existing research rarely involves the spatially refined calculation of PTR and the quantitative analysis of its influencing factors. In this study, based on multi-source geospatial big data, we propose a novel computational framework to solve the above problems. Specifically, we first design a linear programming-based three-step method, which realizes the calculation of PTR at 500-meter grid-pair scale for the first time; secondly, we develop a Beta-binomial model for regression analysis, which improves by more than 50% compared with traditional generalized linear models. The case of Wangjing area in Beijing shows that: the overall PTR in Wangjing is only 16%, which is much lower than the official expectation (45%), and less than 20% of origin–destination (OD) pairs meet the standard; among the influencing factors, the travel duration gap between public transportation and private cars, walking distance, number of transfers, and residential parking density have significant negative effects on PTR. Finally, this paper provides an implication of the proposed computational framework, i.e., the accurate detection of public transportation (PT) supply–demand imbalance areas, which proves its great potential in refined transportation optimization and sustainable urban planning.",2023

Urban planners and designers must develop urban forms that address these challenges. With the integration of new communication and information technologies (Smartphone, GIS, Drones, IoT, Sensors, etc.), urban activities have generated large volumes of urban data. The rapid growth in terms of collection and big data storage capacities combined with the ever-increasing computational power of modern machines have made possible their efficient treatment using machine (ML) and deep learning (DL) algorithms. The emergence of such groundbreaking methods has in turn helped to address the challenges of modern-day cities in several domains (health, security, mobility, etc). ML algorithms have been proposed to model the urban form’s indicators for intelligent urban planning decision making. They have been proven to perform better than the traditional methods. However, the potential of ML has not yet been fully explored in research for urban planning decision support.

First and foremost, an overview of the urban forms, sources of urban data, the ML and DL techniques as well as their potential in solving the aforementioned challenges. For each ML method, we will highlight it working principle, advantages, disadvantages and potential applications using comparative tables. Finally, we will discuss the issues and challenges of ML methods in urban form’s modeling while ultimately advocating some future research directions.",2022

However, it is evident that not just a single factor, but rather a multitude of factors, influence the accessibility and use of UGSs. Consequently, this study aims to systematically review the determinants of accessibility and use of UGSs, highlighting their complex interrelations through a socio-ecological framework. By conducting a literature review across two major databases, Scopus and Web of Science (WOS), a total of 163 articles published between 1988 and January 31, 2024, were included in this study.

Furthermore, it identifies key determinants affecting individuals’ accessibility and use of UGSs, including personal/individual, socio-cultural, physical/environmental, institutional, transport, and psychological factors. Based on these findings, a conceptual framework is proposed to better understand the dynamics of UGS accessibility and use. This framework is designed to aid planners and designers in improving and equalizing the distribution of UGSs to meet the diverse needs of the community comprehensively and serves as a foundational guide for future research.",2024

The large size and complexity of cities pose ongoing and essential challenges in obtaining precise data on building occupancy. The current examination of this topic simply looks at the data source and the model, lacking of their scope of application or the influencing factors behind occupancy pattern. Based on the perspective of urban to building-scale, multi data sources and mobility models in all domains, along with potential factors that influence occupancy patterns were systematically reviewed in this study. Currently, there are two main challenges in occupancy pattern generation in UBEM: 1) difficulty in obtaining data with both accuracy and breadth, and 2) difficulty in developing occupancy pattern models through tradeoffs between model complexity, accuracy, and interpretability. Therefore, combination of multi-source data should be employed to obtain a more accurate representation of occupancy pattern within a city and future research should establish fit-for-purpose framework to find the best modeling method for UBEM. What’s more, the interpretable model considering comprehensive influencing factors should be further established. In conclusion, this study provides a series of suggestions for future advancements in obtaining accurate and interpretable occupancy patterns in UBEM.",2024

We utilized CiteSpace software to conduct a time-zone analysis of the relationship between heatwaves, green spaces, and health using clustered data from 2001 to 2023. This study evaluates the role of green space systems in mitigating high temperatures and enhancing mental health within the environmental health risk assessment framework. Using CiteSpace software, we analyzed literature from 2001 to 2023, focusing on the interactions among heatwaves, green spaces, and health. Our results indicate that most existing research concentrates on hazard identification, with insufficient exploration of the dose-response relationships between green spaces and temperature reduction. Quantitative studies on green space design and spatial optimization are scarce, and guidance on effective configurations remains limited. Additionally, the health impacts of heatwaves vary by region, with a noticeable imbalance in research focus; Asia and Africa, in particular, are underrepresented in studies addressing heatwave effects. We conclude that effective mitigation strategies require: (1) a comprehensive environmental health risk assessment framework that integrates advanced methods like big data analysis and geospatial simulations to improve green space planning and design; (2) further theoretical exploration into the mechanisms by which green spaces regulate temperature and mental health, including detailed analysis of spatiotemporal patterns and the functional optimization of green space structures; and (3) the development of robust parameterized design guidance based on specific therapeutic dosages (green space stimulus) to optimize configurations and enhance the effectiveness of green spaces in mitigating adverse mental health impacts from deteriorating thermal environments.

Consequently, to derive valuable insights from transportation big data, it is essential to leverage the Hadoop big data platform for analysis and mining. To summarize the latest research progress on the application of Hadoop to transportation big data, we conducted a comprehensive review of 98 relevant articles published from 2012 to the present. Firstly, a bibliometric analysis was performed using VOSviewer software to identify the evolution trend of keywords. Secondly, we introduced the core components of Hadoop. Subsequently, we systematically reviewed the 98 articles, identified the latest research progress, and classified the main application scenarios of Hadoop and its optimization framework. Based on our analysis, we identified the research gaps and future work in this area. Our review of the available research highlights that Hadoop has played a significant role in transportation big data research over the past decade. Specifically, the focus has been on transportation infrastructure monitoring, taxi operation management, travel feature analysis, traffic flow prediction, transportation big data analysis platform, traffic event monitoring and status discrimination, license plate recognition, and the shortest path. Additionally, the optimization framework of Hadoop has been studied in two main areas: the optimization of the computational model of Hadoop and the optimization of Hadoop combined with Spark. Several research results have been achieved in the field of transportation big data. However, there is less systematic research on the core technology of Hadoop, and the breadth and depth of the integration development of Hadoop and transportation big data are not sufficient. In the future, it is suggested that Hadoop may be combined with other big data frameworks such as Storm and Flink that process real-time data sources to improve the real-time processing and analysis of transportation big data.

In particular, the link between urban morphology and energy systems has become increasingly crucial as cities continue to expand and become more densely populated. Achieving climate neutrality adds another layer of complexity, highlighting the need to address this relationship to develop effective strategies for sustainable urban energy infrastructure. The occurrence of extreme climate events can also trigger cascading failures in the system components, leading to long-lasting blackouts. This review paper thoroughly explores the challenges of incorporating urban morphology into energy system models through a comprehensive literature review and proposes a new framework to enhance the resilience of interconnected systems. The review emphasizes the need for integrated models to provide deeper insights into urban energy systems design and operation and addresses the cascading failures, interconnectivity, and compound impacts of climate change and urbanization on energy systems. It also explores emerging challenges and opportunities, including the requirement for high-quality data, utilization of big data, and integration of advanced technologies like artificial intelligence and machine learning in urban energy systems. The proposed framework integrates urban morphology classification, mesoscale and microscale climate data, and a design and operation process to consider the influence of urban morphology, climate variability, and extreme events. Given the prevalence of extreme climate events and the need for climate-resilient strategies, the study underscores the significance of improving energy system models to accommodate future climate variations while recognizing the interconnectivity within urban infrastructure.",2023

A comprehensive review of big data-based urban environment, society, and sustainability (UESS) research is much needed. The aim of this study was to summarize the big data-based UESS research using a systematic review approach in combination with bibliometric and thematic analyses. The results showed that the numbers of publications and citations of related articles have been increasing exponentially in recent years. The most frequently used big data in UESS research are human behavior data, and the major analytical methods are of five types: classification, clustering, regression, association rules, and social network analysis. The major research topics of big data-based UESS research include urban mobility, urban land use and planning, environmental sustainability, public health and safety, social equity, tourism, resources and energy utilization, real estate, and retail, accommodation and catering. Big data benefit UESS research by proving a people-oriented perspective, timely and real-time information, and fine-resolution spatial dynamics. In addition, several obstacles were identified to applying big data in UESS research, which are related to data quality and acquisition, data storage and management, data security and privacy, data cleaning and preprocessing, and data analysis and information mining. To move forward, future research should integrate multiple big data sources, develop and utilize new methods such as deep learning and cloud computing, and expand the application fields to focus on the interactions between human activities and urban environments.

Emerging Geospatial Big Data (GBD) are considered as the supplement to RS data, and help to contribute to our understanding of urban lands from physical aspects (i.e., urban land cover) to socioeconomic aspects (i.e., urban land use). Integrating RS and GBD could be an effective way to combine physical and socioeconomic aspects with great potential for high-quality urban land use classification. In this study, we reviewed the existing literature and focused on the state-of-the-art and perspective of the urban land use categorization by integrating RS and GBD. Specifically, the commonly used RS features (e.g., spectral, textural, temporal, and spatial features) and GBD features (e.g., spatial, temporal, semantic, and sequence features) were identified and analyzed in urban land use classification. The integration strategies for RS and GBD features were categorized into feature-level integration (FI) and decision-level integration (DI). To be more specific, the FI method integrates the RS and GBD features and classifies urban land use types using the integrated feature sets; the DI method processes RS and GBD independently and then merges the classification results based on decision rules. We also discussed other critical issues, including analysis unit setting, parcel segmentation, parcel labeling of land use types, and data integration. Our findings provide a retrospect of different features from RS and GBD, strategies of RS and GBD integration, and their pros and cons, which could help to define the framework for future urban land use mapping and better support urban planning, urban environment assessment, urban disaster monitoring and urban traffic analysis.",2021

As the world becomes increasingly urbanised, there is recognition that public and planetary health relies upon a ubiquitous transition to sustainable cities. Disentanglement of the complex pathways of urban design, environmental exposures, and health, and the magnitude of these associations, remains a challenge. A state-of-the-art account of large-scale urban health studies is required to shape future research priorities and equity- and evidence-informed policies.
Objectives
The purpose of this review was to synthesise evidence from large-scale urban studies focused on the interaction between urban form, transport, environmental exposures, and health. This review sought to determine common methodologies applied, limitations, and future opportunities for improved research practice.
Methods
Based on a literature search, 2958 articles were reviewed that covered three themes of: urban form; urban environmental health; and urban indicators. Studies were prioritised for inclusion that analysed at least 90 cities to ensure broad geographic representation and generalisability. Of the initially identified studies, following expert consultation and exclusion criteria, 66 were included.
Results
The complexity of the urban ecosystem on health was evidenced from the context dependent effects of urban form variables on environmental exposures and health. Compact city designs were generally advantageous for reducing harmful environmental exposure and promoting health, with some exceptions. Methodological heterogeneity was indicative of key urban research challenges; notable limitations included exposure and health data at varied spatial scales and resolutions, limited availability of local-level sociodemographic data, and the lack of consensus on robust methodologies that encompass best research practice.
Conclusion
Future urban environmental health research for evidence-informed urban planning and policies requires a multi-faceted approach. Advances in geospatial and AI-driven techniques and urban indicators offer promising developments; however, there remains a wider call for increased data availability at local-levels, transparent and robust methodologies of large-scale urban studies, and greater exploration of urban health vulnerabilities and inequities.",2024

The study examines the transformative impact of these technological interventions on the evaluation of walkability trends over the period 2015 to 2022. We create a framework consisting of big data sources, machine learning methods, and research purposes, revealing research trajectories and associated challenges. Despite diverse data usage, image data dominates in walkability research. While street view and point of interest data were primarily used to depict the environment, social media and handheld/ wearable data were more commonly employed to represent user behaviours or perceptions. Leveraging machine learning in conjunction with big data assists researchers in three aspects of walkability studies. First, researchers utilise classification and clustering to predict street quality, walkability, and identify neighbourhoods with certain characteristics. Second, researchers unveil relationship between the built environment and pedestrian perceptions or behaviours through regression analysis. Third, researchers employ generative models to create streetscapes or urban structures, although their utilisation is limited. Meanwhile, challenges persist in data access, customisation of machine learning models for urban studies, and establishing standard criteria to guarantee data quality and model accuracy.",2024
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jag.2023.103412,,A Bi-LSTM approach for modelling movement uncertainty of crowdsourced human trajectories under complex urban environments,"Movement uncertainty, Crowdsourced human trajectories, Pedestrian motion detection, GNSS","Modelling the movement uncertainty of crowdsourced human trajectories in complex urban areas is useful for various human mobility analytics and applications. However, the existing human movement uncertainty modelling approaches only consider the largest movement distance or speed, and fixed sampling and measurement errors, resulting in limited accuracy in uncertainty prediction. To fill this gap, this paper presents a Bi-directional Long Short-Term Memory (Bi-LSTM) assisted framework for modelling the uncertainty of crowdsourced human trajectories under complex urban environments. The proposed movement uncertainty modelling framework adaptively integrates the pedestrian motion detection characteristics, including the real-time gait-length and heading deviation features under detected step period. The characteristics are further combined with the Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) originated location, speed and virtual heading information and constructed as the input features for the uncertainty prediction model. Comparison with the existing uncertainty modelling methods is conducted using the real-world datasets, and the results demonstrate the presented Bi-LSTM assisted framework’s robust outperformance in achieving more adaptive and accurate movement uncertainty prediction, as measured by multiple metrics. This study provides an accurate and practical solution for modelling the movement uncertainty of human trajectories under complex urban areas, and can support reliable analytics for crowdsourced urban big data.",2023

To close the research gap that previous studies have disregarded the dynamic environmental factors and trajectory data, we propose a framework that comprises four sub-indices: safety, comfort, accessibility, and vitality. Utilizing open-source data, advanced deep neural networks, and GIS spatial analysis, the framework eliminates subjective evaluations and is more efficient and comprehensive than prior methods. The experimental results on Xiamen, China, demonstrate the effectiveness of the framework in identifying areas for improvement and enhancing cycling mobility. The proposed framework provides a structured approach for evaluating bikeability in different geographical contexts, making reproducing bikeability indices easier and more comprehensive to policymakers, transportation planners, and environmental decision-makers.",2023

However, effectively harnessing the power of crowdsourced data within the complex landscape of urban tourism governance, especially in China marked by rapid growth and dynamic shifts in the tourism market, remains hindered by institutional constraints and capacity limitations. This study critically examines three pivotal challenges in urban tourism governance in China, stemming from the ever-evolving tourism demand dynamics: resource management, tourism promotion, and regional collaboration. In response to these challenges, we propose an innovative framework for tourism governance that capitalizes on crowdsourced data, comprising eight distinct analytical functions. To validate the efficacy of this novel approach grounded in crowdsourced information, empirical tests were conducted in Shenzhen and Jiangmen, China, using data sourced from Dianping.com, often dubbed the “Yelp of China.” The dataset encompassed 1,496 tourist attractions and 184,357 tourist reviews for Shenzhen, along with 559 attractions and 2,811 reviews for Jiangmen. By leveraging the proposed framework and its designated functions, we formulate policy recommendations for the advancement of tourism in Shenzhen and Jiangmen. Finally, we explore the potential advantages of adopting the crowdsourced information-based approach to tourism management, shedding light on its implications for both governmental and corporate entities.",2023
